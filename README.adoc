= Better Taskbar

A program that removes the windows taskbar and replaces it with a new one.

.Motivations:
- Windows taskbar is ugly ahh
- Windows taskbar is not customizable at all
- Windows taskbar has no media controls
- Linux taskbars from https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Example-configurations/[here] look awesome and I want them
- I hate Windows but require it for literally everything (no wine will not work)
- That wheel sure is getting rebuilt
